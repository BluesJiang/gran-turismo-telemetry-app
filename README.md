v0.1.0-beta2

## Usage

Open PS5 and launch the game. Then open the app, enter the IP address of your PS5 (make sure your PS5 and PC use the same router. If you use a network accelerator, connect your PC to it to make sure PC can connect to the PS5). You can find the IP address in the network settings of the PS5.


After entering the ip address, click "连接" button to connect. If you can see the graph show the throttle(green), brake(red), speed(blue) up and down, it means a success connection.

Now you can click "开始录制" to open start record the telemetry data. Click "停止录制"  to stop recording. You can change the saving path in the "设置". Records will be saved to the path with the '.rec' extension (the extension has not been settled becase it's a beta version).


Next, click "打开回放" to enter playback window. Click "+" to open a file you just record. And choose some Lap to analyze and compare!
